/**
 * Per-task "keep alive" state — the user's opt-in to have dev3 auto-revive this
 * task's agent conversation when it dies (process exited, usage/rate limit hit,
 * or a network/proxy error killed it). A property of the task, in the same class
 * as {@link Task.draft} / {@link Task.hibernated}: it is **never a column, a kind,
 * or an action**, and it is inert on its own — only the bun watchdog scheduler
 * reads it, and only for a task whose agent should be running. Absent/null on
 * every pre-existing task, so older app versions reading the same `tasks.json`
 * simply ignore it.
 *
 * Only {@link enabled} is the durable user choice; the rest is watchdog
 * bookkeeping, refreshed each tick and safe to lose on restart.
